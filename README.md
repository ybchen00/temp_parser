# New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) Temperature Sensor Data Scraping #

NYCHA regularly updates a [web page](https://my.nycha.info/PublicSite/Transparency/IndoorTemp) that displays information about indoor temperature sensor data by each development. 

## Morph.io scraper ##
This web scraper runs daily and extracts the data from all of these tables and saves the results in a SQLite database. The scraper is hosted on [morph.io](http://morph.io/).

See [temp_scraper](https://my.nycha.info/PublicSite/Transparency/IndoorTemp) on morph.io.
